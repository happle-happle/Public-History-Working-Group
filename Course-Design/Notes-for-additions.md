- [paraphrasing from Yoyo's Presentation to Experimental Capture course at CMU's STUDIO for Creative Inquiry]
The volcap isn't perfect because theirs lots of occlusions (areas the camera cannot see) but what really mattered is that
there was something you were all watching together, it's not him really playing right now, but it is something ephemeral or temporary
about it. 

- *Note from H.Apple*

- *I'm reminded of the Shoah Foundation at USC's new directions in oral testimony. Eva Hayward's critique was about the fantasy of this 
technology to keep people from dying. This being an uninterrogated desire to force their individuals to live in their trauma forever as 
powerful affective tools, perhaps distancing them from their own experience as something aside from its utility as a narrative of nationalized trauma.
What ever allows for them to be something not used for poltical theater? Isn't this an important form of violence to investigate? Especially in a world
where digital content creation shapes who is and is not a subject worthy of protection from violence (consider israel's role in deminutiziung palestinian genocide?)*
