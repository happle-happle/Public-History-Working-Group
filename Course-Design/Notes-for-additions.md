Notes Document for Harrison Apple for consideration as additions to full program agenda

**Yoyo Munk - Tin Drum** 
Ryuichi Sakamoto / Volumetric Capture project

[![Ryuichi Sakamoto Volumetric Capture by Tin Drum](/Repo-Image-files/ryuichithumb.jpg)](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/ryuichi-sakamoto-tin-drum-mixed-reality-the-shed-2312616)


- [paraphrasing from Yoyo's Presentation to Experimental Capture course at CMU's STUDIO for Creative Inquiry]
The volcap isn't perfect because theirs lots of occlusions (areas the camera cannot see) but what really mattered is that
there was something you were all watching together, it's not him really playing right now, but it is something ephemeral or temporary
about it. 

- *Note from H.Apple*

- *I'm reminded of the Shoah Foundation at USC's new directions in oral testimony. Eva Hayward's critique was about the fantasy of this 
technology to keep people from dying. This being an uninterrogated desire to force their individuals to live in their trauma forever as 
powerful affective tools, perhaps distancing them from their own experience as something aside from its utility as a narrative of nationalized trauma.
What ever allows for them to be something not used for poltical theater? Isn't this an important form of violence to investigate? Especially in a world
where digital content creation shapes who is and is not a subject worthy of protection from violence (consider israel's role in deminutiziung palestinian genocide?)*

**Github GcollectionBuilder**
Github Pages supported digital exhibition design. Steper learning curve and specific information layout (history timelines, maps, featured items)

**Eva Heyward - Spider City Sex** 

[![Blonde woman, headshot with red lipstick](/Repo-Image-files/eva-hayward-thumb.png)]([https://news.artnet.com/art-world/ryuichi-sakamoto-tin-drum-mixed-reality-the-shed-2312616](https://www.vfw.or.at/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hayward_Eva_Spider_City_Sex.pdf))

- I often think about what we have to offer one another as a motivation for teaching (as opposed to upholding subject expertise). I would like to contribute to queer histor in the city, but I have come to believe that through my bibliography of oral and public history that this is only a possibility if we build a cultural, intellectual, and artistic relationship, a cohort of people who internalize these stories as ways of navigating Pittsburgh, that is to say to move around with a common sense of history. One of the many things Heyward offers in this essays is somatic experience of her transition beyond "gender" and "identification." It's an enhancement / an unpredictable and compelling change in her realtionship to the world, the psychoanalytic definition of sexuality, the underpinning of the erotic, which is not about men and women and the question of reproduction through sex, but sex as the refashioning of matter through cultural and molecular incision/inscription.

**Harrison Apple - Book Proposal Writing Exercise**
- I have a project about how my research usually took place in people's homes, and I was learning about how Pittsburgh was made up of alienated living quarters that simultaneously extended the stories I was tracing from the 20s to the 60s to the 90s. Could we have a guest speaker and writing exercise as one of the meetups?


**Harrison Apple - Media Engagement Activity with TheatriQ - Preview of Piece for BrewHouse Show**
- Meeting with TheatriQ group. Preview of piece in BrewHouse Show, open vcr, mark making on VHS tape, 10 in ensemble. live recording and playback, playback as an involved, longterm, and rewarding process.
- queer speakeasy, underwater, giving them a context for queer nightlife, I don't care if they're historically accurate because people created what they wanted and needed. That's the core of what I'm attracted to. There's room to speculate about whatever it is that looms in your future.
- Intro - get a sense of what they're up to, where they're at with the piece, engage them in conversation about what kidn of relationships we can have to history (speculative, reverent so on), and finish with the playback activity (briung camera and vhsj slide projectors and popup screen.
- Bringing the slide projector and reel opens up the opportunity to explain that I've fabricated a kind of artifact. It's a "slide" that is new of image data about an "old" slide, copied from a Jpeg, Exported from the video data on a DVD, encoded from a capture card, receiving an analog composite signal from a VCR, playing back a reel of VHS tape, imprinted with a magnetic writer head, receiving data from a sensor, received from the light cast through a slide, that has long since disappeared but is not with certainty beyond finding. The question is what you expect the find in the original and why you believe you want it?
- These are records from a private membership club, which is a nebulous and intentionally meaningless community identification. It escapes the expectations of collective action toward representation in the public sphere. I learned this by finding patterns between the recorded interviews I took with former members / officers and the cultural studies works that address how we know when we "belong" to something that is not itself a citizenship or a blood relative.
 
**Harrison and Bekezela work zoom call 1-21-2025**
- The body liberation project, Chrissy King, https://www.ujamaacollective.org/ (sp?)
- The body is not an apology, Sonya Renee Taylor
- cultivate more practice together, be courageous, not allow myself to be gaslit, abused, harmed. I'm going to be with people who will affirm one another.
- exhibition this summer, trans artist with queer pedagogical approaches to teaching. Bekezela supporting some curation. Connected to tiny wpa
  - tiny wpa
  - collection of banned queer books

**Timeline**
Deliverables:
- curriculum
  - 4 or 5 scheduled meet ups with all participants
    - pick dates (could be date ranges)
    - arrange topics / activities by those dates
    - outline materials that you and I will choose ahead to provide
    - Who we would like to be able to pay to give guest engagements (possibilities). Getting space to center trans and non-binary practitioners. Sometimes the issue is that the archivist is not trans but they are the story holder for the important subject matter which is.
       - Dominique Luster (virtual)
       - Jules Gill-Peterson (virtual)
       - Dave Barnabo and Kate Barbara co-owners of Bright Archive (local)

       - Sinead Bligh [(Queer Afterlives - Artists in the Archives - Mattress Factory)](https://www.haa.pitt.edu/event/queer-afterlives-artist-archives)
       - 
  - A meeting by meeting agenda of skills we'd like to share, ideas we would like collectively discuss and process,
  - A draft of expected outcomes for participants:
      - a plan for future activity with the resources provided by the time together as a cohort (event/reading group/research project collective or individual)
      - some documentation of what we did together and how we would like to see it stewarded past this grant funded time period. Like web documentation, a publication that's printed and distributed, an exhibition or public event where the cohort.
   
Writing the invitation - "Naming what we are valuing", building the air of the container:
- Opportunity, naming it a "summer school" that ideally continues annually or in whichever way it can live on. Building as communities, building the spaces that we need.
- We are community organizing, this is one approach to community organizing through our lens that we want to be sharing with others so that they also have access to it. New skills, Reminding them of Skills they have, culture building, peer mentorship.
- Realizing and remembering early political homes, and cultural work homes, shaping a sense of self, community. An opportunity to support others in that.
- A strong statement to deliver, not just what we're gonna do but why we want to do this together, right now. Writing this invitation.
- We have to be ok with what we value and be very clear, because oppressors will twist our perception, to make us feel shame about what we value.
- The formal institution of valuing human memory, does not value us the way we do, and coming to terms with that.
- Western archival practice reinforces the need for an institution.
- Embodied Stewardship as people who are memory keepers, record keepers, culture keepers, practice keepers. A resistant form. What is the liberatory potential of holding the memory of the drum. Haitian revolution, spiritual practices that were necessary to aid that. What even has the potential to be an archive.
- A couple years ago Bekezela gave a talk "how do we do museums now" given the critical conversations and experiences, the pathways of how we get to this moment are so full. The interrogation. The interrogation of the archive may have liberatory potential.
- A movement toward practice over inert preservation. Seed keeping, planting and seeing what happens. Harvesting in a new season. An organic approach, it's messy and uncertain. Has taught Bekezela things about letting go control of something as part of "keeping" it. The illusion of control that we're also wanting to contend with when we talk about working with archives. A way to demonstrate that we were here, left a mark, made an impact and at the same time we have been taught to keep records in a certain way. We can interrogate that. What's a freer a more liberated way to be an archivist or memory keeper, more liberated than "we have to have the stuff." If the culture of keeping a story in a person and sharing it with others who internalize, share, and pass it down. We don't have to have the "stuff" to have the story.
  - the cultural lens in important and thinking about / looking at indigenous practices for archiving in important. How we keep memory and how we value how we keep it is as important as keeping something. Having some space, this sensibility that in an academic space it's treated as more valuable to have the thing than a larger memory about it.
- an irony of the archiving field is wanting to contain everything and be changed by nothing. the museum and archival field is an industry and part of our challenge is how do we stop industry. It's connected to capital, it trains people to wish to be collective, to question non-industry approaches.
- maybe we already do these quotidian ways of remembering because we know that we will die. The person at the cookout taking pictures, they're the documentarian, someone interested in record keeping. And it doesn't need a dominant institution to validate it.
- We can be naming and speaking to community, how we perceive library and archive work. That can be a contribution to community or practice.
