Notes Document for Harrison Apple for consideration as additions to full program agenda

**Yoyo Munk - Tin Drum** 
Ryuichi Sakamoto / Volumetric Capture project

- [paraphrasing from Yoyo's Presentation to Experimental Capture course at CMU's STUDIO for Creative Inquiry]
The volcap isn't perfect because theirs lots of occlusions (areas the camera cannot see) but what really mattered is that
there was something you were all watching together, it's not him really playing right now, but it is something ephemeral or temporary
about it. 

- *Note from H.Apple*

- *I'm reminded of the Shoah Foundation at USC's new directions in oral testimony. Eva Hayward's critique was about the fantasy of this 
technology to keep people from dying. This being an uninterrogated desire to force their individuals to live in their trauma forever as 
powerful affective tools, perhaps distancing them from their own experience as something aside from its utility as a narrative of nationalized trauma.
What ever allows for them to be something not used for poltical theater? Isn't this an important form of violence to investigate? Especially in a world
where digital content creation shapes who is and is not a subject worthy of protection from violence (consider israel's role in deminutiziung palestinian genocide?)*

**Github GcollectionBuilder**
Github Pages supported digital exhibition design. Steper learning curve and specific information layout (history timelines, maps, featured items)

**Eva Heyward - Spider City Sex** 

[![Blonde woman, headshot with red lipstick](/Repo-Image-files/eva-hayward-thumb.png)]([https://news.artnet.com/art-world/ryuichi-sakamoto-tin-drum-mixed-reality-the-shed-2312616](https://www.vfw.or.at/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Hayward_Eva_Spider_City_Sex.pdf))

- I often think about what we have to offer one another as a motivation for teaching (as opposed to upholding subject expertise). I would like to contribute to queer histor in the city, but I have come to believe that through my bibliography of oral and public history that this is only a possibility if we build a cultural, intellectual, and artistic relationship, a cohort of people who internalize these stories as ways of navigating Pittsburgh, that is to say to move around with a common sense of history. One of the many things Heyward offers in this essays is somatic experience of her transition beyond "gender" and "identification." It's an enhancement / an unpredictable and compelling change in her realtionship to the world, the psychoanalytic definition of sexuality, the underpinning of the erotic, which is not about men and women and the question of reproduction through sex, but sex as the refashioning of matter through cultural and molecular incision/inscription.

**Harrison Apple - Book Proposal Writing Exercise**
- I have a project about how my research usually took place in people's homes, and I was learning about how Pittsburgh was made up of alienated living quarters that simultaneously extended the stories I was tracing from the 20s to the 60s to the 90s. Could we have a guest speaker and writing exercise as one of the meetups?


**Harrison Apple - Media Engagement Activity with TheatriQ - Preview of Piece for BrewHouse Show**
- Meeting with TheatriQ group. Preview of piece in BrewHouse Show, open vcr, mark making on VHS tape, 10 in ensemble. live recording and playback, playback as an involved, longterm, and rewarding process.
- queer speakeasy, underwater, giving them a context for queer nightlife, I don't care if they're historically accurate because people created what they wanted and needed. That's the core of what I'm attracted to. There's room to speculate about whatever it is that looms in your future.
- Intro - get a sense of what they're up to, where they're at with the piece, engage them in conversation about what kidn of relationships we can have to history (speculative, reverent so on), and finish with the playback activity (briung camera and vhsj slide projectors and popup screen.
- Bringing the slide projector and reel opens up the opportunity to explain that I've fabricated a kind of artifact. It's a "slide" that is new of image data about an "old" slide, copied from a Jpeg, Exported from the video data on a DVD, encoded from a capture card, receiving an analog composite signal from a VCR, playing back a reel of VHS tape, imprinted with a magnetic writer head, receiving data from a sensor, received from the light cast through a slide, that has long since disappeared but is not with certainty beyond finding. The question is what you expect the find in the original and why you believe you want it?
- These are records from a private membership club, which is a nebulous and intentionally meaningless community identification. It escapes the expectations of collective action toward representation in the public sphere. I learned this by finding patterns between the recorded interviews I took with former members / officers and the cultural studies works that address how we know when we "belong" to something that is not itself a citizenship or a blood relative.
