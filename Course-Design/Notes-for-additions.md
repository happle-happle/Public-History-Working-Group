- [paraphrasing from Yoyo's Presentation to Experimental Capture course at CMU's STUDIO for Creative Inquiry]
The volcap isn't perfect because theirs lots of occlusions (areas the camera cannot see) but what really mattered is that
there was something you were all watching together, it's not him really playing right now, but it is something ephemeral or temporary
about it. 

- *Note from H.Apple*

- *I'm reminded of the Shoah Foundation at USC's new directions in oral testimony. Eva Hayward's critique was about the fantasy of this 
technology to keep people from dying. This being an uninterrogated desire to force their individuals to live in their trauma forever as 
powerful affective tools, perhaps distancing them from their own experience as something aside from its utility as a narrative of nationalized trauma.
What ever allows for them to be something not used for poltical theater? Isn't this an important form of violence to investigate? Especially in a world
where digital content creation shapes who is and is not a subject worthy of protection from violence (consider israel's role in deminutiziung palestinian genocide?)*

**Eva Heyward - Spider City Sex**

- I often think about what we have to offer one another as a motivation for teaching (as opposed to upholding subject expertise). I would like to contribute to queer histor in the city, but I have come to believe that through my bibliography of oral and public history that this is only a possibility if we build a cultural, intellectual, and artistic relationship, a cohort of people who internalize these stories as ways of navigating Pittsburgh, that is to say to move around with a common sense of history. One of the many things Heyward offers in this essays is somatic experience of her transition beyond "gender" and "identification." It's an enhancement / an unpredictable and compelling change in her realtionship to the world, the psychoanalytic definition of sexuality, the underpinning of the erotic, which is not about men and women and the question of reproduction through sex, but sex as the refashioning of matter through cultural and molecular incision/inscription.
