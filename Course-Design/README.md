**Introductions**

We are at [ STUDIO or Kingsley Association ] for our first meeting, held from 6 PM to 9 PM.

The goal for today is to introduce the Public History Summer School, what our motivations are for having done it, who funded it, who all is in attendance, and what we will be doing together privately as well as with public events. 

We go over an outline schedule for this meetup: the further summer schedule (June 18th, and two weeks in July and August), discuss how participants will receive their research funds & equipment, and finally the kind of documentation we should consider part of our being together so that we can share what worked with others. Embodied Stewardship as people who are memory keepers, record keepers, culture keepers, practice keepers. A resistant form. What is the liberatory potential of holding the memory of the drum. Haitian revolution, spiritual practices that were necessary to aid that. What even has the potential to be an archive.

**Some Opening Conversation Topics**

Bekezela and Harrison have a conversation with the group about the Summer School, touching on literacy, how to talk about power, our relationship to archives and the institutions that dictate the use of the word, the way that we listen to others and how we learn. Everyone in attendance has been invited because of something they already do, a pool of methods and ways of articulating what they do that will useful to one another.


The interrogation of the archive may have liberatory potential. A movement toward practice over inert preservation. Seed keeping, planting and seeing what happens. Harvesting in a new season. An organic approach, it's messy and uncertain. Letting go control of something as part of "keeping" it. The illusion of control that we're also wanting to contend with when we talk about working with archives. A way to demonstrate that we were here, left a mark, made an impact and at the same time we have been taught to keep records in a certain way. What's a freer a more liberated way to be an archivist or memory keeper, more liberated than "we have to have the stuff"? If the culture of keeping a story is in a person and sharing it with others who internalize, share, and pass it down, we don't have to have the "stuff" to have the story. The cultural lens in important. Thinking about / looking at indigenous practices for archiving in important. How we keep memory and how we value how we keep it is as important as keeping something.


This conversation is a transition to introducing everyone to one another (Bekezela, Harrison, and the 15 cohort members).

**The Imagined Outcome**

The Summer School is a workshop for participants who are *about to* start on a research project that is not yet fully formed. During the summer school we will talk about our research questions, refining how to identify the kind of learning we want to do, the outcomes we imagine, and ultimately developing a plan of action for how to get there. 

Participants have all applied with a research project in mind and our goal is to have everyone reach August with actionable next steps to execute, a system of documentation so they can keep track of their research, as well as literal tools needed to carry it out.

The first month should be able to identify the questions being asked by all of the participants, pointing to the methods that they can incorporate into their practice. Emphasis being on practice, not mastery. We are all going to be helping one another try something beyond our comfort / confidence. Methods to be expected include: oral history interviews (individuals and groups), accessing archival collections in traditional institutions, managing collected material (analog, digital, paper etc), audio/visual editing for publication, accessible platforms for sharing digital collections, creating a budget based on your research project, and ...

Each participants is going to receive a $1,000 stipend by the end of the program to use on their project: nominal for a project in total but certainly enough to produce a shareable outcome of their research, in turn able to be used to gather greater support (volunteer labor, outreach, grant funding).

**Structure**

The structure of this summer school is inspired by Courtney Ehrlichman and Jasdeep Khaira's Flight School of artists in Pittsburgh. Obvious departures are that this is more arts and humanities research than entrepreneurial training, however the impetus to give people time space and community to workshop their practice into a more sustainable model was very successful and we are currently experiencing a simultaneous surge in motivation to produce more accurate and rich knoweldge of minority lived histories & experiences as well as a known gap in resources to activate these ideas.

We have 6 meetings over June, July, and August however there is plenty of room to meet with one another and as a group outside of these specific gatherings. Projects may turn increasingly collaborative and priorities may shift. The summer school is flexible enough to support this transformation. Participants will share contact information with one another in the first meeting: this might work best with a shared thread like signal, or another platform as the group feels comfortable -  slack, gchat, email lissterv, shared google doc, a standing date at a coffee shop / bar/ venue whatever.

**Documentation**

The Summer School deliverable is documentation of *project design*. What that means for us is the process of refining our projects from initial inquiry to a plan that can be shared, supported, and acted upon. Towards that end, we will share and annotate these outcomes as part of this github repository. This documentation is necessary for each participant as they build a vision of their research projects to share with others. Likewise it is a condition of our proposal that we share documentation of this summer school as an open source plan for others to attempt on their own. Documentation items might look like:
<ul>Version history of research question</ul>
<ul>Annotated bibliographies of gathered material</ul>
<ul>Interview subjects</ul>
<ul>Timelines for research stages</ul>
<ul>Budgets for project</ul>
<ul>Sketches / renderings / prototypes</ul></ul>

We can anonymize information according to the ethical needs of each participant, including ommitting or changing names and locations.
